- Return array of extracted lines
- Compile histogram of lines
  - Figure out how many frames to use (might depend on capture frequency?)
- Determine where the camera is in relation to the extracted lines
- Determine if dominant line is necessary for situation with both lines
- Determine dominant line over time using Histogram
- Calculate desired path using offset from dominant line (if necessary)
- Use histogram of lines to seed where to look during next line detection stage
