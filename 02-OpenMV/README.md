# How To Run Gen3Car 'Cyclops" (OpenMV Car)

## 1. Intro to control algorithms

Note: The same concepts apply to controlling anything, not just cars: Robots, airplanes, etc
PID was invented by a US Navy sailor tasked with autonomously steering boats. He derived the P, I and D terms by watching helmsman steer boats. His 1922 system was better than the sailors, but was not implemented due to resistance from sailors.

## 2. Install the IDE and test the car
2.1. Install the OpenMV IDE https://openmv.io/pages/download 

## 3. Grab the code from github and put it in the ide: https://github.com/Sashulik/Detroit-Autonomous-Vehicle-Group/tree/master/02-OpenMV 
3.1. Run it on the car (Ask someone for a quick how to)
3.2. Modify the PID (look for !!! in the code)
3.3. Run it and see how it goes
3.4. Modify the code by the !!! to make it fail
3.5. Modify the code so it succeeds but is different the the original values

## 4. Get the car to follow a different color line

## 5. Optimize for faster lap time
5.1. Switch to inside color
5.2. Increase car speed
5.3. Tune the PID
